# Online_voting_platform
Project aiming at creation of online voting platform
which could be possibly used by companies, association etc.

Application is using Spring Boot with several dependencies: Jpa, Security, Web, Thymeleaf, Lombok. For data storage is using PostgreSQL relation database.

Application in the end of development phase should be able to store user data (security, basic identification) and companies 
data (votes, votes result). It will be able to represent results in form or graphs, pdfs or reports which could be send into e-mail
after vote is finished (and store historic data).
